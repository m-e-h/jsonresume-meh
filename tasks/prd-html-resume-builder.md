# Product Requirements Document: HTML Resume Builder

## Introduction/Overview

This project will create an HTML resume builder that transforms JSON resume data into professional, print-ready HTML resumes. The system will consume a `resume.json` file following the JSON Resume Schema standard and generate multiple template options for developers to showcase their professional experience. The primary focus is on providing a seamless development experience with live preview capabilities and multiple output formats.

**Problem Statement:** Developers need a simple, customizable way to create professional resumes from structured data that can be easily maintained, version-controlled, and deployed as static HTML.

**Goal:** Build a Vite-powered resume generator that converts JSON Resume Schema data into beautiful, print-optimized HTML resumes with multiple template options and PDF export capabilities.

## Goals

1. **Template Variety:** Provide multiple professional resume template options for different use cases
2. **Standards Compliance:** Full compatibility with JSON Resume Schema specification
3. **Print Optimization:** Generate resumes that look professional both on screen and when printed
4. **Developer Experience:** Offer live preview with hot reload for rapid iteration
5. **Export Flexibility:** Support both HTML and PDF output formats
6. **Theming Support:** Enable basic customization through CSS variables
7. **Error Handling:** Provide clear validation and error messages for malformed JSON data
